walk:
 - Implement walk class
    - Generate walks of length N on some lattice L.
    - Effeciently reset and rewind walks that are invalid so as to efficiently
      generate walks.
    - Introduce "moves" on generated walks to create new states quickly.
log:
 - Be able to log important data about the walks and the lattice
    - mean square end to end distance
    - number of steps
    - number fraction of lattice occupation
