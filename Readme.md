#saw_sim

Code used to simulate self avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice. Periodic and
finite boundary conditions are supported. The code is intended to be used to
determine the distribution of RMS end-to-end distances of self avoiding walks
(SAW) on a lattice as a function of concentration. Essentially, we are using
this simulation to show that as the number fraction of occupied lattice sites
-> 1, the self avoiding walks take on a Gaussian distribution (i.e. acting like
ideal random walks).
